- A program to solve sudoku puzzles, using human-like two algorithms.

- Cannot solve all sudoku puzzles that can be deterministically solved, however, never renders an incorrect answer.

Algorithm 1: Checks each square and counts candidate numbers for that square: if only one candidate, place it.
Algorithm 2: Checks each set (row, column, and section) and counts candidate locations for each number: if only one candidate location, place number there.
